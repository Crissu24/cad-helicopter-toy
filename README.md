# Helicopter Toy Design in CATIA

This project showcases the design and assembly of a helicopter toy using CATIA. The project includes the complete 3D model of the helicopter, with each component meticulously designed and assembled. The parts are named in Romanian to reflect the detailed construction of the helicopter.

## Project Overview
This project involves the design of a helicopter toy, including the body, tail, rotors, and motor assembly. Each part has been modeled separately and then assembled to create a functional toy helicopter. The project demonstrates the use of CATIA's powerful 3D modeling capabilities.


## Components

This is the complete assembly of the helicopter toy. It includes all the individual components brought together.



### 2. Helicopter Body (Caroseria Elicopterului)
